## HR Analytics Project

## Project Overview

This HR analytics project aims to analyze employee attendance and working preferences for the first quarter of the fiscal year, which runs from April to March. The data provided by the HR manager includes records from April, May, and June 2022, each stored in separate sheets. The project involves combining these datasets to gain insights into employee behavior, specifically focusing on Work from Home (WFH), Work from Office (WFO), Sick Leave, and overall attendance patterns.

## Problem Statement

The HR manager seeks to understand the working preferences of employees by analyzing:

Work from Home (WFH) percentage

Work from Office (WFO) percentage

Sick Leave percentage

Additionally, the project tracks overall employee attendance through the Presence Percentage and investigates the reasons behind the observed working preferences and attendance patterns.

## Data Description

The dataset is structured across three sheets (April 2022, May 2022, and June 2022) with the following key columns:

Employee Code: Unique identifier for each employee.

Employee Name: Name of the employee.

Daily Attendance: Columns representing each day of the month, with values indicating:

P: Present

WFH: Work from Home

SL: Sick Leave

WO: Weekly Off

PL: Paid Leave

Other codes: Representing various types of leave or absence.

Summary Columns: Total counts for different categories like WFH, PL (Paid Leave), SL (Sick Leave), etc.

## Objectives

Data Consolidation: Merge the three monthly datasets into a single, comprehensive dataset.

Attendance Analysis: Calculate the percentage of days employees were WFH, WFO, and on Sick Leave across the three months.

Reason Analysis: Investigate the reasons behind different attendance types to identify any underlying trends or issues.

Presence Tracking: Calculate the Presence Percentage to monitor overall employee attendance.

## Tools & Techniques

Data Processing: Power Query for data cleaning, merging, and transformation.

Data Analysis: Power BI and DAX language for creating measures, calculated columns, and visualizations.

Visualization: Power BI for developing a dashboard that reflects the analysis results.

Key reasons behind employee attendance and absence patterns.

Trends in overall employee presence across the three months.
